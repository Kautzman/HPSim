# HPSim

Healing Simulator for WoW.  SimCraft doesn't model healing well and I feel we need some of that.

Primary Goals:
- Be able to effectively derive various healing metrics from custom fights definitions and custom healing strategies.
  - HPS, Efficiency, Identify 'problem areas' in your spec or strategy.
- Create something that's more accessible for casual use than SimCraft.
- Make the oupt easy to handle on a high level without sacrificing detailed reporting.
- Allow for rapid development iteration with smart infrastructure.

Secondary Goals:
- Make the UI pretty and inviting - UX matters
- Allow users to manipulate state and iterate easily and quickly.
- Allow users to 'step into' the simulation and watch it in real time with cast bars and party frames and stuff(or a function of real time e.g. 1x - 16x)
  - Besides being helpful for debugging, it hopefully helps a user understand the kind of decision-making that gets done by a strategy.

Features (Hopefully):
- User-Definable Fight Definitions.
- User-Definable AI / Strategy Definitions.
- Scripting not required.  Define your strategy and fight through the UI.
- Functional / Sexy UI.
- User-Definable spells?  Maybe?
